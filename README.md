# element-words

Uses atomic element symbols to spell an inputted word. This program finds all possible spellings of a word using elements. If the word cannot be spelled fully, the program goes as far as possible.

See details and a demo at my website [here](https://www.ramseyboyce.com/javascript_demos/element_words/element_words.html).
